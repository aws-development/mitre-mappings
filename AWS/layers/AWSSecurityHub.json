    "description": "AWS Security Hub is a tool that supports the aggregation, organization, and prioritization of security alerts and findings from multiple services including Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, Amazon Macie, AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) Access Analyzer, AWS Systems Manager, AWS Firewall Manager, and AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions. To do this, AWS Security Hub relies on managed insights which are collections of findings that identify security areas that need to be addressed as well as custom checks for different detections. While AWS Security Hub supports  custom insights and numerous AWS Config checks, this mapping focuses only on the managed insights  and the custom Security Hub checks provided by Amazon. Custom managed insights and AWS Config checks are considered out of scope for this mapping as the custom managed insights will vary from organization  to organization and AWS Config has its own mapping. \n",
