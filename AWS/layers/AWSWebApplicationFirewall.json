AWS WAF can be configured to control how Amazon CloudFront, Amazon API Gateway REST API, Application Load Balancer, and AWS AppSync GraphQL API respond to web requests. This mapping focuses on the AWS Managed Rules rule groups currently available. It does not cover paid solutions from Amazon or managed rules from Amazon Marketplace. ",
