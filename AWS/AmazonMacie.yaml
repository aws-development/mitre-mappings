  Amazon Macie is a fully managed data security and data privacy service that uses machine learning and pattern matching
  to help you discover, monitor, and protect sensitive data in your AWS environment.  Macie automates the discovery of
  sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and financial data, to provide you with a better
  understanding of the data that your organization stores in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

  Macie also provides you with an inventory of your S3 buckets, and it automatically evaluates and monitors those buckets
  for security and access control. Within minutes, Macie can identify and report overly permissive or unencrypted buckets
  for your organization.

  If Macie detects sensitive data or potential issues with the security or privacy of your data, it
  creates detailed findings for you to review and remediate as necessary.

        value: Minimal
        comments: >-
          The following Macie findings can detect the collection of data from S3 buckets:
          Policy:IAMUser/S3BlockPublicAccessDisabled
          Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketEncryptionDisabled
          Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketPublic
          Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketReplicatedExternally
          Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketSharedExternally

          This type of detection is limited to only the S3 storage type and not other storage types available on the
          platform (such as file or block storage) and therefore has Minimal coverage resulting in a Minimal score.

          The following Macie findings can protect against collection of sensitive data from S3 buckets:
          SensitiveData:S3Object/Credentials
          SensitiveData:S3Object/CustomIdentifier
          SensitiveData:S3Object/Financial
          SensitiveData:S3Object/Multiple
          SensitiveData:S3Object/Personal

          The ability to discover this type of sensitive data stored in a bucket may lead to hardening steps or removing the
          data altogether which would prevent an adversary from being able to collect the data.

          This type of protection is limited to only the S3 storage type and not other storage types available on the
          platform (such as file or block storage) and therefore has Minimal coverage resulting in a Minimal score.

          Macie only provides detection of this technique for the S3 storage type and not other storage types offerred by
          the platform such as file or block storage resulting in a Minimal coverage score resulting in an overall score
          of Minimal.

              The following Macie findings can detect attempts to replicate data objects from a monitored bucket to an
              Amazon Web Services account that isn't part of your organization:

              Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketReplicatedExternally
              Policy:IAMUser/S3BucketSharedExternally

              This type of detection is limited to only the S3 storage type and not other storage types available on the
              platform (such as file or block storage) and therefore has Minimal coverage resulting in a Minimal score.

          Macie only provides detection for the Credentials in Files sub-technique of this technique and only for the S3
          storage type resulting in Minimal coverage and an overall Minimal score.

              The following Macie findings can result in protecting sensitive data (e.g. credentials) from being collected
              from data stored in S3 buckets:

              SensitiveData:S3Object/Credentials
              SensitiveData:S3Object/Multiple

              S3 buckets can be mounted as file systems on some platforms (e.g. Linux) and therefore its objects can be
              accessed as normal files.  Consequently hardening these objects or removing the credentials altogether can
              protect against adversaries harvesting these credentials.

              This type of detection is limited to only the S3 storage type and not other storage types
              available on the platform (such as file or block storage) and therefore has Minimal coverage resulting in
              a Minimal score.

  Although the service detects the instance of sensitive data, it does not create an alert for the
  user to take immediate action. It does create a log report which the user can then view to see the
  results of the scan jobs.
