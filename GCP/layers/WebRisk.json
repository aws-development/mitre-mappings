Unsafe web resources include social engineering sites\u2014such as phishing and deceptive sites\u2014and sites that host malware or unwanted software. With the Web Risk, you can quickly identify known bad sites, warn users before they click infected links, and prevent users from posting links to known infected pages from your site.",
